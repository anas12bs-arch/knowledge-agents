Bliki: Sensible Default

A Sensible Default is a practice that, absent some overriding context,
  should be used when carrying out a certain kind of task. In software
  development such sensible defaults might include things like “use version
  control”, “separate UI logic from domain logic”, “automate deployment
  pipelines”. 

 The term “sensible default” is a deliberate contrast to “best practice”.
  Folks dislike calling things “best practice” because that term implies a
  general presumption that the best practice is something we should always
  expect to do. A “sensible default”, however, is something that should be
  reassessed in a new context, something that can (and should) be overridden
  when circumstances change. 

 I first heard the term when it was popularized within Thoughtworks by Evan
  Bottcher. He got the name from talking to James Ross, and found the phrasing
  appealing as carried the nuance he was seeking, a known-good starting
  point. 

 
 A sensible default is what we'd expect you to do, the practices to apply,
    if there are no hard constraints in the environment. Do these practices, or
    do better, and be prepared to explain why you've chosen some other way. 

 -- Evan Bottcher 
 

 Thoughtworks has since made much of this concept, including  publishing
  a playbook  of the ones we use. We expect people to be familiar with these
  defaults, ready to use them when starting any new piece of work. They are our
  defaults because we've used them in many situations and found them to be
  effective. But teams should also be familiar with their limitations, and able
  to judge whether they should be changed depending on the particular
  circumstances. As the  twelfth agile principle 
  says: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
  effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.” We also reassess
  these defaults regularly - this is the heart of the  Thoughtworks Technology
  Radar .
