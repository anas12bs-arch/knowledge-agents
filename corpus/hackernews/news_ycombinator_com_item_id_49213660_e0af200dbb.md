# Ask HN: In your experience, what are sound conventions for e-ink UI development?

TL;DR I&#x27;m looking for advice regarding browser-based frontend development from people with practical e-ink UI experience. My specific device is a Bigme Hibreak Pro BW but I&#x27;m aiming for relatively broad compatibility.<p>I&#x27;ve recently switched to a black-and-white e-ink smartphone with the motivation of withdrawing from the attention economy somewhat and it&#x27;s a genuinely cool piece of hardware. While the majority of my needs are met by this device there are a few things I&#x27;d like to have which don&#x27;t work terribly well with the e-ink screen. I&#x27;m planning to implement a couple of projects to fill these gaps, at the moment I&#x27;m planning a Lemmy frontend and an OpenRouter frontend specifically for e-ink. Both are to be browser-based rather than native, to maximise compatibility and because I&#x27;m much more familiar with the web than Android development.<p>I would like to study the principles of sound e-ink UI design before approaching these projects to avoid creating unusable slop, in particular I am not entirely sure how to approach treating the refreshes as a first-class aspect of the design when I can&#x27;t control them from the browser, and how to apply comprehensible UI conventions when a greyscale, high-contrast display is the target.<p>Some specific problems I have out of the gate are:<p>* Streaming LLM output to the screen is basically the worst-case scenario for e-ink, I need to buffer it and paint it in chunks without this becoming horrible to use.<p>* Ghosting is a serious problem, browsing HN on the device is a particularly obvious example. Ideally I want to avoid scrolling as far as possible and rely on pagination instead, which I feel has the potential to become annoying if not done well.<p>* Given I must rely exclusively on layout and type to carry the UI, what design languages emphasise these qualities best? My gut says the early Mac OS versions wouldn&#x27;t be a bad place to start, this seems relevant given the display constraints of the early macs.<p>I would greatly appreciate any advice on the design and implementation of e-ink UIs from people with practical experience in this area. This is purely to scratch a personal itch, once they&#x27;re nailed down I&#x27;ll put them out in the wild under the GPL.
