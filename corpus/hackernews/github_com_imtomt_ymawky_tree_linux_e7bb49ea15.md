This is ymawky, a now-dynamic web server written entirely in ARM64 Assembly. I&#x27;ve previously posted about ymawky here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=48080587">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=48080587</a><p>In the past month and a half, I&#x27;ve made some pretty major improvements: I&#x27;ve added CGI scripting support, so the server now supports query strings and dynamic content; and I&#x27;ve fully ported ymawky to run on Linux, rather than macOS-only.<p>In addition to GET&#x2F;PUT&#x2F;HEAD&#x2F;DELETE&#x2F;OPTIONS requests, because of CGI support ymawky also accepts POST requests (only to CGI resources for now).<p>I&#x27;ve also updated the more detailed writeup to reflect CGI support and the Linux port: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imtomt.github.io&#x2F;ymawky&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imtomt.github.io&#x2F;ymawky&#x2F;</a>
