# Show HN: Gander, an Android file viewer that asks for no permissions at all

Hi HN,<p>I built an Android file viewer that opens PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images, video, audio, Markdown and code, and asks for no permissions at all.<p>I have always been uneasy about opening files people send me. On Android you either install a 400 MB office suite and sign in or use a small free viewer that wants storage access and ends up uploading your file to a server to render it. Also the hassle of having to download different apps for different file formats was really annoying.<p>Gander holds no permissions, not even INTERNET so the OS itself guarantees the file cannot leave the phone.<p>PDFs use Pdfium, media uses Media3, and Office formats are rendered by bundled JS libraries in a WebView and so no request goes to any server.<p>It is a viewer only. Complex PowerPoint decks come out approximately right, spreadsheet charts are not drawn, and old binary .doc and .ppt are unsupported. I&#x27;ll work on it as issues come up :P<p>It is 14 MB, MIT licensed and uploaded on Github releases.<p>Do try it! I would love some feedback especially on files that render badly or need new support.
