Hi HN, I&#x27;m Ahmad from the Intuned (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intunedhq.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intunedhq.com</a>) team. Today, we&#x27;re releasing and open-sourcing Selector Forge (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selectorforge.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selectorforge.ai&#x2F;</a>), a browser extension that generates reliable CSS&#x2F;XPath selectors using AI.<p>You can use it to create a selector for a single element or for an array of elements. The selectors it creates are meant to be &quot;semantic&quot; and more resilient to page changes than what Chrome DevTool’s “Copy Selector” (and other similar extensions) give you. Those tend to hand you something brittle like `#top &gt; div.w-100.ph0-l.ph3.ph4-m &gt; h1 &gt; span`, which can break with a minimal page change. Selector Forge aims for selectors that don&#x27;t break as easily. Here are some selectors that Selector Forge created:  `&#x2F;&#x2F;div[@aria-label=&quot;Showing weekly downloads&quot;]&#x2F;&#x2F;p[@aria-live=&quot;polite&quot;]` (item selector) and `&#x2F;&#x2F;*[local-name()=&#x27;svg&#x27; and @aria-label=&quot;Download statistics&quot;]&#x2F;following-sibling::div`   (list selector).<p>Here is a video demo of using the extension: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8IjjeDQkKmo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8IjjeDQkKmo</a><p>Selector Forge on Chrome: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromewebstore.google.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;lbendfnlmhdakbeblajoffkfmafbfaha" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromewebstore.google.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;lbendfnlmhdakbeblaj...</a><p>Selector Forge on Firefox:

We quickly figured out that the most fragile part of any browser code is usually the selectors and that creating good selectors can go a long way towards improving the quality and reliability of the automation itself.<p>So we abstracted selector creation into its own agent, wrapped it as a tool, and let our codegen agent call it. LLMs by default don&#x27;t do a great job generating good selectors, so this turned out to be really useful and improved the code our agent generates.<p>We recently thought that this piece (the selector agent&#x2F;creation) is useful on its own (outside our platform) so we packaged it as a browser extension. That’s this post!<p>Selector Forge is open source, and the version in the browser stores (Chrome and Firefox) is free for up to 200 selectors&#x2F;month. Unlimited usage is part of our paid plans.<p>We realize most developers aren&#x27;t writing this kind of code by hand anymore, so the next step is exposing this functionality in a way coding agents can call directly, over a CLI or MCP. Here&#x27;s our roadmap: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Intuned&#x2F;selector-forge#roadmap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Intuned&#x2F;selector-forge#roadmap</a><p>Excited to hear your thoughts, questions, and feedback!
