Hello HN, I don&#x27;t post on here much, but wanted to get some eyes on a new project I&#x27;m just launching. I think we definitely need one more AI code agent..<p>I&#x27;m a long-term C++ dev, and over 30+ years I&#x27;ve created some successful audio dev tools (JUCE, the Tracktion DAW, the Cmajor DSP language). All of these came from me getting annoyed with something I had to use, and deciding to have a go at my own take on whatever it was.<p>So Juggler is my attempt at an AI code agent, after spending too many hours loving what the models could do, but hating the CLI experience, and having some opinions of what a better UX might be for this stuff.<p>Lots more blurb on the website and github, but a quick tech dump which might grab your attention if you&#x27;re into these things:<p>A session is a document, not a log file. Each conversation is a Yjs CRDT tree. It can branch into sub-threads (recursively), and you can drill down, backtrack, edit, undo&#x2F;redo, and inspect everything: tool calls, approvals, and the raw context JSON going to the model, etc. The UI is based around Finder-style Miller columns rather than a big doom-scroll, and is quick to navigate.<p>Because it&#x27;s a CRDT behind a local web server, multiple clients can attach P2P to a live session: the native desktop app, a browser tab, or your phone. Run the headless server on the box where the code lives, view it from wherever.<p>Almost everything is a JavaScript plugin: every item in the context (read&#x2F;write&#x2F;bash&#x2F;etc.), the LLM loop strategies, slash commands, and their UIs. You can inspect, fork, or replace any of them. I don&#x27;t do much agent customisation myself, but lots of people do, and I&#x27;d love to see what they think of with this plugin API.<p>Go backend, Wails for windowing (no Electron), plain type-checked JS (strict JSDoc), Yjs for the documents. Usual BYOK provider support: Claude (CLI or API), OpenAI&#x2F;Codex, Gemini, Ollama, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, etc.<p>The app&#x27;s AGPLv3; the extension SDK and bundled extensions are Apache-2.0, so extensions have no copyleft strings attached. No signup, no telemetry, trying to make it frictionless for people to try it out..<p>It&#x27;s very much a beta, and is a one-man side project. It hasn&#x27;t yet had a proper kicking from the real world, but I&#x27;m confident some people with similar preferences to my own will like it!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juggler.studio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juggler.studio</a>
