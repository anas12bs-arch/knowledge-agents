Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;m excited to show off this really fun project I put together. I originally built this project 2-3 years ago, AI was already booming at the time, however voice AI agents were still very early. I loved my proof of concept at the time, but wasn&#x27;t quite happy with it.<p>I recently had the desire to check out the tech again, and know many of you will be interested.<p>Interviews are speech to speech with OpenAI&#x27;s gpt-realtime-2.1 over WebRTC. This model is... expensive, and because of that, I have to add some amount of restrictions, conversations are tied to a authenticated Clerk user id. I have also added a 30 minute timer because well, I really don&#x27;t want to go broke while I sleep tonight.<p>Each suspect has a tool they call when you make a direct accusation. It captures who you accused and a faithful list of the evidence you actually stated.<p>A separate gpt-5-mini judge then decides which of the case&#x27;s required evidence facts you genuinely presented. Paraphrasing counts, vague suspicion and fishing don&#x27;t.<p>The rest is Next.js, MongoDB, and Clerk.<p>Let me know whether the suspects hold up under a real interrogation.
