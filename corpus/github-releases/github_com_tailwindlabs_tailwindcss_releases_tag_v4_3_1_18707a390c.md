# tailwindlabs/tailwindcss v4.3.1 released

> Source: github-releases | Category: changelog | 2026-06-16T18:13:22Z

## tailwindlabs/tailwindcss — v4.3.1

### Added

- Add `--silent` option to suppress output in `@tailwindcss/cli` ([#20100](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20100))

### Fixed

- Remove deprecation warnings by using `Module#registerHooks` instead of `Module#register` on Node 26+ ([#20028](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20028))
- Canonicalization: don't crash when plugin utilities throw for unsupported values ([#20052](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20052))
- Allow `@apply` to be used with CSS mixins ([#19427](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19427))
- Ensure `not-*` correctly negates `@container` queries, including `style(…)` queries ([#20059](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20059))
- Ensure `drop-shadow-*` color utilities work with custom shadow values containing `calc(…)` ([#20080](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20080))
- Fix 'Sourcemap is likely to be incorrect' warnings when using `@tailwindcss/vite` ([#20103](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20103))
- Ensure `@tailwindcss/webpack` can be installed in Rspack projects without requiring `webpack` as a peer dependency ([#20027](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20027))
- Canonicalization: don't suggest invalid `calc(…)` expressions (e.g. `px-[calc(1rem+0px)]` → `px-[calc(1rem+0)]`) ([#20127](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20127))
- Canonicalization: avoid suggesting large spacing-scale values for arbitrary lengths (e.g. `left-[99999px]` → `left-[99999px]`, not `left-24999.75`) ([#20130](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20130))
- Ensure `@tailwindcss/cli` in `--watch` mode recovers when a tracked dependency is deleted and restored ([#20137](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20137))
- Ensure standalone `@tailwindcss/cli` binaries are ignored when scanning for class candidates ([#20139](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20139))
- Ensure class candidates are extracted from Twig `addClass(…)` and `removeClass(…)` calls ([#20198](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20198))
- Don't crash in the Ruby or Vue preprocessors when scanning files containing invalid UTF-8 bytes ([#19588](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19588))
- Allow `@variant` to be used inside `addBase` ([#19480](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19480))
- Ensure `@source` globs with symlinks are preserved ([#20203](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20203))
- Ensure later `@source` rules can re-include files excluded by earlier `@source not` rules ([#20203](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20203))
- Upgrade: don't migrate empty class rules to invalid `@utility` rules ([#20205](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20205))
- Ensure transitions between `inset-shadow-none` and other inset shadows work correctly ([#20208](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20208))
- Ensure explicitly referenced `@source` directories are scanned even when ignored by git ([#20214](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20214))
- Ensure `@source` globs ending in `**/*` preserve dynamic path segments to avoid scanning too many files ([#20217](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20217))
- Canonicalization: don't fold `calc(…)` divisions when the result would require high precision (e.g. `w-[calc(100%/3.5)]` → `w-[calc(100%/3.5)]`, not `w-[28.571428571428573%]`) ([#20221](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20221))
- Serve ESM type declarations to ESM importers of `@tailwindcss/postcss` ([#20228](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20228))

### Changed

- Generate `0` instead of `calc(var(--spacing) * 0)` for spacing utilities like `m-0` and `left-0` ([#20196](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20196))
- Generate `var(--spacing)` instead of `calc(var(--spacing) * 1)` for spacing utilities like `m-1
