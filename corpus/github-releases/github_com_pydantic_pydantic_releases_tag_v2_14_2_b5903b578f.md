# pydantic/pydantic v2.14.2 released

> Source: github-releases | Category: changelog | 2026-10-29T20:31:52Z

## pydantic/pydantic — v2.14.2

## v2.14.2 (2026-10-29)

This release addresses 2 security issues, https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-qpmf-fgh3-ff25 and https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-3r8g-cqwr-jr29.

#### Packaging

* Bump PyO3 to 0.30.1, jiter to 0.18.0, use `PyFrozenDict` by @Viicos in [#14003](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14003)
* Bump speedate to v0.18.0 by @Viicos in [#14007](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14007)
* Publish `pydantic-core` wheels for PyPy 8.0 (`pp80` ABI) by @Viicos in [#14083](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14083)

#### Performance

* Avoid Python tuple allocation during model fields validation by @Viicos in [#13955](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/13955)
* Lazily call repr of values during nested union serialization by @Viicos in [#14082](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14082)
* Skip decorator field checks when no field decorators exist by @alexmojaki in [#14111](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14111)
* Avoid heap allocation for small JSON model field buffers by @alexmojaki in [#14113](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14113)

#### Fixes

* Make JSON validation by iteration consistent with Python approach by @davidhewitt in [#13275](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/13275).

  JSON validation now handles field lookup and extra data the same way as Python validation. In particular, keys that only match an
  unused alias or field name are now treated as extra data, instead of being silently dropped:

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict
    from pydantic.alias_generators import to_camel


    class Page(BaseModel):
        model_config = ConfigDict(extra='forbid', alias_generator=to_camel)

        page_size: int = 10


    Page.model_validate_json('{"page_size": 50}')
    # Before: Page(page_size=10)
    # After: ValidationError (extra_forbidden)
    ```

  See the [pull request](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/13275) for the full list of behavior changes.
  This change addresses https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-qpmf-fgh3-ff25.

* Ignore extra data matching a field name in `TypedDict` and dataclasses with `extra=allow` by @Viicos in [#14090](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14090). Addresses https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-3r8g-cqwr-jr29.
* Fix unpickling of generic classes defined in separate module by @Viicos in [#13994](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/13994)
* Support explicit `by_alias` overriding `validate_by_alias` in validation JSON schemas by @Viicos in [#13997](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/13997)
* Fix mypy plugin crash on deferred empty model by @ilevkivskyi in [#14027](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14027)
* Fix infinite recursion when validating an invalid default with `PydanticUseDefault` by @Viicos in [#14028](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14028)
* Implement recursion guard for `validate_strings()` by @Viicos in [#14029](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14029)
* Support named tuples in `Sequence` serialization by @Viicos in [#14033](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14033)
* Take `preserve_empty_path` into account in URL types equality by @Viicos in [#14035](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14035)
* Fix pickling of `PydanticCustomError` and `ValidationError`s containing custom errors by @Viicos in [#14051](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14051)
* Do not extract attribute docstrings from nested classes and functions by @Viicos in [#14052](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14052)
* Fix forward annotations evaluation and type variables substitution when rebuilding parametrized generic models by @Viicos in [#14054](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14054)
* Fix `Self` resolution in parametrized generics by @Viicos in [#14065](https://github
