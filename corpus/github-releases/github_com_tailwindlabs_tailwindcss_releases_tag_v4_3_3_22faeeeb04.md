# tailwindlabs/tailwindcss v4.3.3 released

> Source: github-releases | Category: changelog | 2026-07-16T12:05:33Z

## tailwindlabs/tailwindcss — v4.3.3

### Fixed

- Support `--watch --poll[=ms]` in `@tailwindcss/cli` when filesystem events are unreliable or unavailable ([#20297](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20297))
- Canonicalization: match arbitrary hex colors against theme colors case-insensitively (e.g. `bg-[#fff]` and `bg-[#FFF]` → `bg-white`) ([#20298](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20298))
- Prevent Preflight from overriding Firefox's native `iframe:focus-visible` outline styles ([#20292](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20292))
- Ensure `theme('colors.foo')` in JS plugins resolves correctly when both `--color-foo` and `--color-foo-bar` exist ([#20299](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20299))
- Ensure fractional opacity modifiers work with named shadow sizes like `shadow-sm/12.5`, `text-shadow-sm/12.5`, `drop-shadow-sm/12.5`, and `inset-shadow-sm/12.5` ([#20302](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20302))
- Parse selectors like `[data-foo]div` as two selectors instead of one ([#20303](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20303))
- Ensure `@tailwindcss/postcss` rebuilds when a preprocessor like Sass changes the input CSS without changing the input file on disk ([#20310](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20310))
- Ensure CSS nesting is handled even when Lightning CSS isn't run, such as in `@tailwindcss/browser` and Tailwind Play ([#20124](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20124))
- Prevent achromatic theme colors from shifting hue when mixed in polar color spaces like `oklch` ([#20314](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20314))
- Ensure `--spacing(0)` is optimized to `0px` instead of `0` so it remains a `<length>` when used in `calc(…)` ([#20319](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20319))
- Load `@parcel/watcher` only when needed in `@tailwindcss/cli --watch` mode, so one-off builds and `--watch --poll` work when `@parcel/watcher` can't be loaded ([#20325](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20325))
- Use explicit platform fonts instead of `system-ui` and `ui-sans-serif` so CJK text respects the page's `lang` attribute on Windows ([#20318](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20318))
- Prevent `@tailwindcss/upgrade` from rewriting ignored files when run from a subdirectory ([#20329](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20329))
- Ensure earlier `@source` rules pointing to nested files are scanned when later `@source` rules point to files in parent folders ([#20335](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20335))
- Prevent `@tailwindcss/vite` from triggering full page reloads when scanned files are processed by Vite but haven't been loaded as modules yet ([#20336](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/20336))
