# pydantic/pydantic v2.14.3 released

> Source: github-releases | Category: changelog | 2026-11-05T09:56:49Z

## pydantic/pydantic — v2.14.3

## v2.14.3 (2026-11-04)

### What's Changed

#### Packaging

* Build wheels for GraalPy 3.13 by @msimacek in [#14136](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14136).

  The previous v2.14.2 release published GraalPy 3.11 wheels, which were not working due to a PyO3 version bump. A CI workflow issue made it so that the wheel wasn't tested before publishing. This is now fixed: starting in v2.14.3, we no longer publish GraalPy 3.11 wheels, and GraalPy 3.13 wheels are now published together with the existing 3.12 one.

#### Performance

* Improve schema generation for fixed type handlers by @alexmojaki in [#14130](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14130)
* Skip general schema dispatch for builtin scalars by @alexmojaki in [#14141](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14141)
* Skip annotation handler setup when annotations are empty by @alexmojaki in [#14149](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14149)
* Fix quadratic serialization time with per-index `include`/`exclude` on sequences by @Viicos in [#14160](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14160)
* Avoid type lookups when checking for `None` during serialization by @Viicos in [#14167](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14167)
* Improve performance of model serialization by @Viicos in [#14171](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14171)
* Improve performance of dict serialization by @Viicos in [#14172](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14172)
* Improve performance of type inference during serialization by @Viicos in [#14173](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14173)
* Avoid cloning the field name when using the default value during validation by @Viicos in [#14175](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14175)
* Do not evaluate `model_config` annotations by @Viicos in [#14195](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14195)
* Avoid slow runtime `Protocol` check when expanding `GroupedMetadata` annotations by @Viicos in [#14196](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14196)
* Use a lightweight `@contextmanager` implementation internally by @Viicos in [#14199](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14199)

#### Fixes

* Include `null` in serialization JSON Schema for `unless-none` field serializers by @Kropiunig in [#13848](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/13848)
* Fix `RecursionError` when copying or unpickling models with `defer_build` by @Viicos in [#14115](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14115)
* Remove dead `default_factory` check in unsupported `Field()` attribute by @owtaylor in [#14129](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14129)
* Disallow non string extra keys during validation by @Viicos in [#14135](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14135)
* Fix deeply nested data being reported as a cyclic reference by @Viicos in [#14164](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/14164)
