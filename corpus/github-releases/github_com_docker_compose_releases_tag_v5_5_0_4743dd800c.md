# docker/compose v5.5.0 released

> Source: github-releases | Category: changelog | 2026-08-17T10:19:54Z

## docker/compose — v5.5.0

## What's Changed

> ℹ️  This release overhauls image digest reconciliation to prevent unnecessary container recreation.                                                                                                                                                   
> Existing containers may be recreated the first time you run `compose up` after upgrading, as image digests are re-evaluated using the new logic.                                                                                                      
>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
> `compose pull` now honors `pull_policy` refresh windows (`daily`, `weekly`, `every_N`).
