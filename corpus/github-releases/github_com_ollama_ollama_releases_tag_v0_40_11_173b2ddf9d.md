# ollama/ollama v0.40.11 released

> Source: github-releases | Category: changelog | 2026-10-24T23:39:32Z

## ollama/ollama — v0.40.11

## Speech

Ollama can now generate [speech](https://docs.ollama.com/capabilities/speech) on macOS. `ollama run` plays text or a chat model's reply aloud as the audio is generated, and apps can stream audio through the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint.

```sh
ollama run phonon "Hello from Ollama."
```

## d3 decision models

[d3](https://ollama.com/library/d3) brings vLLM Semantic Router's decision models to Ollama. Give a model text, structured state, or an image, and ask it to classify, answer yes or no, or score options with probabilities. The family includes 2B, 4B, 9B, and 27B sizes.

```sh
ollama run d3 "A customer says their card was charged twice." --ask "Is this a billing issue?"
```
